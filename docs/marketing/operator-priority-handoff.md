# Revenue Operator Priority Handoff

Updated: 2026-04-27T08:00:28.548Z

This is the ranked send order for the current zero-to-one revenue loop. Work warm discovery targets first, then expand into cold GitHub targets with the same proof discipline.

This handoff sits on top of `gtm-revenue-loop.md`, `gtm-target-queue.csv`, and `team-outreach-messages.md` so an operator can decide who to contact next without re-ranking the queue manually.

## Current Snapshot
- Revenue state: cold-start
- Headline: No verified revenue and no active pipeline. Stop treating posts as sales; directly sell one Workflow Hardening Sprint.
- Paid orders: 0
- Checkout starts: 0
- Active follow-ups: 0
- Warm targets ready now: 4
- Cold GitHub targets ready next: 6

## Operator Rules
- Import the queue into the sales ledger before sending anything.
- Lead with one concrete workflow-hardening offer, not generic Pro and not the proof pack.
- Use [VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md](../VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md) and [COMMERCIAL_TRUTH.md](../COMMERCIAL_TRUTH.md) only after the buyer confirms pain.

```bash
npm run sales:pipeline -- import --source docs/marketing/gtm-revenue-loop.json
```

## Follow Up Now
- No in-flight follow-ups are currently tracked.

- Evidence score: 10
- Evidence: warm inbound engagement, workflow pain named: rollback risk, already in DMs
- Motion: Workflow Hardening Sprint
- Why now: Warm Reddit engager already named a repeated workflow risk, so the fastest path is a founder-led diagnostic.
- Proof rule: Use proof pack only after the buyer confirms pain.

First-touch draft:
> Your question about rollback rates when context changes is exactly the right one. I am looking for one AI-agent workflow to harden end-to-end this week: repeated failure, prevention rule, and proof run. If you have one workflow where context drift or rollback risk keeps showing up, I can harden that workflow for you. Worth a 15-minute diagnostic?

- Evidence score: 9
- Evidence: warm inbound engagement, built serious memory systems, workflow pain named: stale context and conflicting facts
- Motion: Workflow Hardening Sprint
- Why now: Warm Reddit engager already works on advanced agent memory, so discovery should center on one repeated failure pattern.
- Proof rule: Use proof pack only after the buyer confirms pain.

First-touch draft:
> Your ACT-R engram work is fascinating, especially the conflict resolution for opposing facts and the decay model. I am looking for one serious AI-agent workflow to harden end-to-end this week. If your memory system has one recurring failure mode such as stale context, opposing facts, bad handoffs, or unsafe tool calls, I can turn that into a prevention rule and proof run.
